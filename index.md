# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up the ultrasonic distance sensor and wiring it up with the Arduino and breadboard. First, I had to find a way to upload code to the Arduino with my Chromebook, so I decided to use Arduino Cloud. I also had to figure out how to code the Arduino so that I could see the distance when it ran. Eventually, I was able to make the ultrasonic distance sensor work properly. The distance was printed out on my screen with each interval of time that passed.

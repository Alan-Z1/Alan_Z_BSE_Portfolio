# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up the ultrasonic distance sensor and wiring it up with the Arduino and breadboard. First, I had to find a way to upload code to the Arduino with my Chromebook, so I decided to use Arduino Cloud. I also had to figure out how to code the Arduino so that I could see the distance when it ran. Eventually, I was able to make the ultrasonic distance sensor work properly. The distance was printed out on my screen with each interval of time that passed.
